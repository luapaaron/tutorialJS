	<div id="title">Javascript</div>
    <div id="normaltext">JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.

The fact that the script is in the HTML page means that your scripts can be seen and copied by whoever views your page. Nonetheless, to my mind this openness is a great advantage, because the flip side is that you can view, study and use any JavaScript you encounter on the WWW.

JavaScript can be used in other contexts than a Web browser. Netscape created server-side JavaScript as a CGI-language that can do roughly the same as Perl or ASP. There is no reason why JavaScript couldn’t be used to write real, complex programs. However, this site exclusively deals with the use of JavaScript in web browsers.

If you don’t have any programming experience at all it’s best to start with some gentle JavaScript examples that teach you the basics. It might be a good idea to buy Negrino & Smith, “JavaScript for the World Wide Web”, 4th edition, Peachpit Press, 2001. It contains some very useful examples and though it doesn’t treat advanced programming tricks, it will certainly help you get started. Of course this site also offers plenty of help.

I can also recommend Jeremy Keith, DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model, 1st edition, Friends of Ed, 2005. This, too, is a book that doesn't delve too deeply into technology, but gives non-programmers such as graphic designers/CSS wizards an excellent overview of the most common uses of JavaScript - as well as the most common problems.</div>

	<div id="title">JavaScript vs. Java</div>
    <div id="normaltext">Although the names are much alike, JavaScript is primarily a scripting language for use within HTML pages, while Java is a real programming language that does quite different things from JavaScript. In addition Java is much harder to learn. It was developed by Sun for use in pretty much anything that needs some computing power.

JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape, as a client side scripting language (even though there's no fundamental reason why it can't be used in a server side environment).

Originally the language was called Live Script, but when it was about to be released Java had become immensely popular (and slightly hypey). At the last possible moment Netscape changed the name of its scripting language to “JavaScript”. This was done purely for marketing reasons. Worse, Eich was ordered to "make it look like Java". This has given rise to the idea that JavaScript is a "dumbed-down" version of Java. Unfortunately there's not the slightest shred of truth in this story.

Java and JavaScript both descend from C and C++, but the languages (or rather, their ancestors) have gone in quite different directions. You can see them as distantly related cousins. Both are object oriented (though this is less important in JavaScript than in many other languages) and they share some syntax, but the differences are more important than the similarities.

If you are a C++ or Java programmer you will be surprised by some of JavaScript’s features. Since I don’t have any previous programming experience, the differences are not described on this site. The best you can do is buy David Flanagan, “JavaScript, the Definitive Guide”, 5th edition, O’Reilly, 2006. In this book the differences between C++/Java and JavaScript are clearly explained. I co–edited a few chapters of this book.</div>

    <div id="title">The JavaScript language</div>
    <div id="normaltext">JavaScript is not a programming language in strict sense. Instead, it is a scripting language because it uses the browser to do the dirty work. If you command an image to be replaced by another one, JavaScript tells the browser to go do it. Because the browser actually does the work, you only need to pull some strings by writing some relatively easy lines of code. That’s what makes JavaScript an easy language to start with.

But don’t be fooled by some beginner’s luck: JavaScript can be pretty difficult, too. First of all, despite its simple appearance it is a full fledged programming language: it is possible to write quite complex programs in JavaScript. This is rarely necessary when dealing with web pages, but it is possible. This means that there are some complex programming structures that you’ll only understand after protracted studies.

Secondly, and more importantly, there are the browser differences. Though modern web browsers all support JavaScript, there is no sacred law that says they should support exactly the same JavaScript. A large part of this site is devoted to exploring and explaining these browser differences and finding ways to cope with them.

So basic JavaScript is easy to learn, but when you start writing advanced scripts browser differences (and occasionally syntactic problems) will creep up.</div>
